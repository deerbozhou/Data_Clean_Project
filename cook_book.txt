1. Overview of Data:
The original datasets were downloaded from a web site https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, which colleted from the experiments.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

After we downloaded the zip files from the web site, we created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following steps to generate two outputs files called clean_data.txt and clean_data_analysis.txt:
a. clean_data.txt: A first tidy data set which merges the training and the test sets using the readable English nameed feature lables and appropritely descriptive activity names 
b. clean_data_analysis.txt: A second, independent tidy data which extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. It uses the first data set (clean_data.txt) 
   to create a new data with the average of each varialble for each activity and each subject
